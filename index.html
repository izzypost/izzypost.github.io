        <p>HEllo my name is Izzy and I am a journalism student with a passion for sport, television, and puppies.  I am a senior who may have to do some extra time with the hopes of working for the NFL or Espn some day.  I am the Director of the sports department for Virginia Tech Television and can be found on the sidelines for most any tech athletic game.  I love what I do and hope to keep progressing in my field.  When I am not at a sporting event you can find me in the dance studio, usually tap dancing (I was tauht by the guy who did happy feet) or going on adventures with my hound dog, Roscoe.</p>

        <h2>My project</h2>
        <p>I have chosen to do my project on Virgina Tech student media, with a focus on VTTV.  Virginia Tech student media includes the Collegiate Times, WUVT fm radio, VTTV (channel 33) and the Bugle (yearbook) all of these organizations on campus are vital for sudents wishing to persue a career in media and gives them marketable expierience to show to future employers.  Studet media, however, is seriously undermined by the university.  All of the listed organiations are run like a business by students and are considered a club in the eyes of the universoty.  Due to this club setting, the executive boards are responsible for funding their activities.  This includes computers, cameras, broadcast material, music access, and more.  Student media has lobbied for years to have the help of Virginia tech and be an asset to their media presence.  All requests have seemed to be ignored.  All branches of the sudent media managememnt are working together this year to have their voice heard and to be treated as the semi-professional journalists that we are. </p>
